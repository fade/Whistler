## 1.10.0 — 2026-05-28


### New Features

#### bpftrace: range-based `for` loops with `break` / `continue`

bpftrace's range form is now supported:

```
for $j : ((uint64)0)..((uint64)max_path_depth) {
  @paths[tid, $j] = str($dentry.d_name.name);
  if ($dentry == $mnt_root) { break; }
  $dentry = $dentry.d_parent;
  continue;
}
```

Lowered to a bounded `dotimes` with two flags: a continue-flag scoped
to the current iteration, and a break-flag scoped to the whole loop.
Statements after a `break` or `continue` in the same lexical scope —
including statements nested inside `if` branches — are skipped via
dynamic-binding-driven wrapping. `while (cond) { … }` gained the same
treatment, so `break`/`continue` work in both shapes.

#### Per-CPU scratch maps lift the 512-byte stack ceiling

Any `struct-alloc` larger than 32 bytes now spills off the BPF stack
into an auto-defined per-CPU array map (`__bt-scratch__`,
`BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY`, `max_entries=1`). The scratch buffer is
looked up once at probe entry and every spilled allocation site
becomes a constant-offset pointer arithmetic into the per-CPU slot —
the same technique bpftrace + libbpf use.

This unlocks scripts whose total state would otherwise exceed BPF's
hard 512-byte stack limit. Opensnoop's `sys_exit` body (multiple
str-var buffers, a for-loop's iteration scratch, chained-field
intermediates) needed ~520 bytes on the stack before; it now compiles
and runs.

#### bpftrace: more positions for `str()` / `kstr()`

`str()` and `kstr()` are now usable as:

- map value: `@filename[tid] = str(args.filename)`
- `$var` value: `$path = str(@filename[tid])`
- printf arg with explicit size: `printf("%.32s", str(p, 32))`

`$var`s backed by a string buffer can be indexed with `$v[i]` (returns
the byte at offset `i`). Combined with literal-string indexing
(`"/"[0]` folds at compile time), conditions like `$path[0] != "/"[0]`
work as written.

#### bpftrace: per-tracepoint `args.FIELD` resolution

`args.FIELD` is now resolved against *the format file of the current
probe's tracepoint*, not via a script-wide `tp-FIELD` macro. This was
silently mis-loading in scripts that attach the same field name to
multiple tracepoints with different layouts. The most common case:
opensnoop attaches `args.filename` to `sys_enter_open` (filename at
offset 16) **and** `sys_enter_openat` (filename at offset 24 — `dfd`
occupies offset 16). The shared macro was using `sys_enter_open`'s
offset for every probe, so on `openat` we were storing the file
descriptor `int` instead of the user pointer, and `probe_read_user_str`
later returned zero bytes — empty filenames in the output.

#### bpftrace: field-chain types flow through `$var = chain` assignments

```
$dentry = curtask.fs.pwd.dentry;   // $dentry now typed as `dentry'
$vfsmnt = curtask.fs.pwd.mnt;       // $vfsmnt typed as `vfsmount'
$mnt_root = $vfsmnt.mnt_root;       // walk through vfsmount struct
```

The `$v = chain; $v.field` stash pattern that bpftrace tools lean on
heavily now works. `field-chain-leaf-struct` walks the chain through
vmlinux BTF and records the leaf pointer's target struct as the
left-hand `$var`'s type. The walker correctly unwraps typedef /
`const` / `volatile` so `const struct qstr *` resolves to `qstr` (and
not to a const-wrapper whose `vlen` is 0).

#### bpftrace: more tool surface

Several bpftrace tools that previously didn't compile now do, thanks
to a long tail of surface-language additions in this window:

- `tuple` keys for composite map keys (`@m[(args.dev, args.sector)]`)
  and `has_key(@m, k)` for explicit presence checks.
- `let @m = lruhash(N);` / `hashmap(N)` top-level map declarations
  (parsed; type inferred from usage).
- `offsetof(struct NAME, FIELD)` resolved at compile time via BTF.
- `cgroup_path()`, `cat()`, `join(argv)`, `buf(ptr, len)` with the
  matching `%r` printf conversion for byte-array output.
- `getopt()` stub returning the literal default value (so scripts
  that use macros built on `getopt("flag", DEFAULT, "help")` parse
  and run as if the flag is unset).
- `time("FMT")` strftime format strings; `%f` microseconds resolved
  from the kernel timestamp.
- `kaddr()` falls back to `/boot/System.map` when `kallsyms` is
  zeroed (the `kptr_restrict` case on hardened distros).
- `elapsed` builtin (script-start nsecs offset, populated via a
  hidden map at runtime).
- `ntop(addr)` as a map value (17-byte family+address layout in the
  map slot).
- `strerror(errno)` rendered as `%s` via userspace `strerror(3)` at
  print time.
- `let` declarations, `comm == "literal"` predicates, `*expr`
  user-pointer deref, 2-arg `delete(@m, k)`, no-paren `if`, `ppid`
  builtin, `func` / `probe` as map keys/values, `$var-typed`
  comparison for `tcplife`-style scripts.

#### bpftrace: minimal C preprocessor + `config = { … }`

`#include <…>` is silently dropped; `#define NAME INT` populates a
per-parse table; `#ifndef BPFTRACE_HAVE_BTF` always takes the
BTF branch. The grammar accepts and ignores top-level
`config = { … }` blocks so existing tools parse without surfacing
their runtime knobs.

#### bpftrace: tool runner robustness

Multi-target probe attachment no longer aborts on the first failure:
individual attach errors are reported and the rest of the probes keep
running. Bare uprobe library names (`uprobe:libssl:SSL_read`) resolve
through `ldconfig -p`.

### Bug Fixes

#### SSA optimizer: `simplify-cfg` linear-chain merger

The CFG-merge sub-pass was using a stale `compute-cfg-edges`
snapshot, doing multiple merges in one sweep, and dropping
non-trivial PHIs whose dst was still in use elsewhere. The downstream
symptom was malformed IR that passed `ir-well-formed-p` (which only
checked vreg defs) and crashed the emitter's jump-fixup pass with
`NIL is not of type NUMBER` — surfacing in `compile-bpf-forms` as the
unhelpful `NIL is not of type COMPILATION-UNIT`.

The pass is now correctness-first:

- Refuses to merge when the successor has any non-trivial PHIs.
- One merge per sweep — the outer `while changed` loop restarts and
  re-runs `compute-cfg-edges` with fresh data.
- Rewrites label references in surviving blocks at the time of the
  merge.

A new `prune-stale-phi-args` pass runs before and after `simplify-cfg`
so PHI arg labels always match the actual predecessor set; single-arg
result collapses to `:mov`, empty result to `(:mov 0)`.

`ir-well-formed-p` now also rejects branch / PHI label args that
reference removed blocks, catching a future regression at the gate
instead of crashing the emitter. `fix-dangling-branches` remains as
defence-in-depth.

#### AST: integer comparisons and constant-test `IF`/`WHEN`/`UNLESS` fold early

`constant-fold-sexpr` now folds integer comparisons (`=`, `/=`, `<`,
`<=`, `>`, `>=`) to `1`/`0` and `(IF int then else)` /
`(WHEN int body)` / `(UNLESS int body)` to the live branch. This
eliminates patterns like `(if 0 …)` — generated by bpftrace's
`getopt(name, false, …)` macros — before they reach the SSA
optimizer's CFG-merge passes.

#### bpftrace: macro `$name` vs bare `name` params no longer conflated

`macro sys_exit(ret, @filename, @paths) { $ret = ret; … }` now
correctly distinguishes the bare `ret` macro param from the local
`$ret` variable. Previously both were substituted with the call-site
value, so `$ret = ret` became `args.ret = args.ret` and downstream
references to `$ret` saw the wrong shape.

#### bpftrace: small surface fixes

- `printf("%.32s", …)` precision spec now parsed and applied to `%s`
  truncation in the userspace formatter (was silently ignored).
- `ntop`'s 17-byte slot layout: address at offset 0, family byte at
  offset 16 (was swapped — broke `printf("%s", $v)` for ntop-typed
  `$var`s read from a map).
- Cast binds to a full postfix expression, not just to a primary, so
  `(struct sock *)retval.field` parses as `cast(retval.field)`
  (matches bpftrace), not `cast(retval).field`.
- `:str` map keys (produced when `func` / `probe` are used as keys)
  now round-trip through pointer-mode map ops without truncation.
- Cross-program shared string buffer: one probe-scope scratch slot
  serves every `gen-string-set` instead of allocating one per
  literal — `writeback.bt`'s 8 × 64-byte reason strings no longer
  blow the 512-byte stack.
- `time()` with no argument emits a real newline, not a literal
  `~%`.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-05-27


### New Features

#### bpftrace-compatible frontend

The Whistler binary now runs scripts written in
[bpftrace](https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace)'s surface language.
Parser, AST passes, and codegen are all in the same SBCL image,
reusing the standard Whistler SSA/regalloc pipeline. No separate
bpftrace install, no clang, no LLVM.

```sh
sudo whistler bpftrace \
  -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat
        { @[comm] = count(); }'
```

The bulk of bpftrace's day-to-day surface is supported:

- **Probes** — `kprobe`, `kretprobe`, `kfunc`, `kretfunc`, `uprobe`,
  `uretprobe`, `tracepoint`, `profile`, `interval`, `BEGIN`, `END`.
  Wildcards (`kprobe:tcp_*`) and multi-target specs
  (`kprobe:foo,kprobe:bar`).
- **Aggregations** — `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `stats`,
  `hist`, `lhist(x, lo, hi, step)`.
- **Async actions** — `printf` (with `%-16s` / `%05d` flag/width
  parsing), `print(@m)`, `clear`, `zero`, `delete`, `time`, `exit`.
- **String / address builtins** — `str(ptr [, n])`, `kstr(ptr [, n])`,
  `ksym(addr)`, `usym(addr)`, `ntop([af,] addr)`, `reg("ip"|"sp"|…)`.
- **Built-in variables** — `pid`, `tid`, `uid`, `gid`, `comm`,
  `nsecs`, `cpu`, `retval`, `curtask`, `args`, `probe`, `func`,
  `kstack`, `ustack`, `$local`, `@global`, composite `@[k1, k2]`.
- **Symbolic constants** — `AF_INET`, `O_RDONLY`, `IPPROTO_TCP`,
  etc. resolved from kernel BTF enums plus a curated `#define`
  table. No C headers needed.
- **Struct access** — `curtask->pid`,
  `((struct sock_common *)arg0)->skc_family` (BTF-resolved scalar
  field offsets).
- **Control flow** — `if`/`else`, ternary, filter `/predicate/`,
  `while` loops (bounded), user-defined `fn` (inlined at AST → IR).

CLI flags match bpftrace's workflow: `-e PROGRAM`, `-l [PATTERN]`,
`-p PID`, `-c 'CMD'`, `--dump`, `-V`, `-h`. The `-c` flag spawns the
target binary `PTRACE_TRACEME`-stopped at exec entry, attaches
probes, then resumes — matching bpftrace's synchronisation so
short-lived commands have probes live for their full lifetime.

See [the bpftrace chapter](https://atgreen.github.io/Whistler/bpftrace/index.html)
of the book for the full reference.

#### Userspace stack symbolisation

A new `whistler/symbolize` package resolves userspace addresses
(typically captured by `bpf_get_stackid` with `BPF_F_USER_STACK`)
into `name+0xOFFSET [library] file:line` strings. Pure Common Lisp:
ELF64 reader for symbol tables, build-ID / `.gnu_debuglink` fallback
for separate debug files, and a DWARF 4 / DWARF 5 `.debug_line`
state-machine interpreter for source file + line. Per-pid
`/proc/<pid>/maps` snapshots survive process exit.

`@[ustack]` in a bpftrace script automatically uses the symboliser
when debuginfo is available; bare hex frames otherwise.

#### kfunc / kretfunc probe support

The loader gained native fentry / fexit (BTF-trampoline) probe
attachment: `BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING` with
`expected_attach_type = BPF_TRACE_FENTRY / FEXIT`,
`attach_btf_id` resolved from `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`, attached
via `BPF_LINK_CREATE`. Both `attach-fentry` (loader) and
`kfunc:` / `kretfunc:` (bpftrace) entry points are wired up.

#### CI: ocicl dependencies + live kernel verifier

CI workflow switched from Quicklisp to [ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl),
with `ocicl.csv` pinning iparse / fiveam plus their transitive
closure by sha256 digest. A new `kernel-verify` job runs
`make test-torture` under `sudo` on the GitHub-hosted runner — all
161 torture programs round-trip through `BPF_PROG_LOAD` on every
push, so verifier regressions surface immediately.

### Bug Fixes

- **BTF parser advance for `BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG`.** The type-table
  parser was missing the 4-byte `component_idx` extra-data step for
  `DECL_TAG` (kind 17). On any modern kernel that emits decl-tag
  records (Fedora 42+, Ubuntu 24.04+), every type record past the
  first decl-tag was indexed against the wrong offset. Symptom:
  `task_struct.pid` resolved to type-id 130091 (a
  `perf_trace_*` function) instead of `pid_t`. Caught while
  wiring up `curtask->pid` for the bpftrace frontend; affected all
  callers of `btf-find-struct` / `btf-struct-fields` on these
  kernels.

- **ctx-vreg liveness across new helper-call ops.** The
  `ctx-loads-early-p` heuristic in the regalloc decision path only
  inspected `:call` for ctx-vreg usage. With the new `:get-stackid`
  op (and the pre-existing `:tail-call`), ctx could be clobbered
  across a real call before its consumers ran, leading to
  `R1 !read_ok` verifier rejections on programs that combined
  ustack with a prior helper call. The check now considers all
  three op kinds.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-05-01


### New Features

- **LSM program support.** The loader now supports Linux Security
  Module (LSM) BPF programs. Programs with `lsm/` section names are
  detected automatically, BTF func IDs are resolved from
  `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`, and attachment uses `BPF_LINK_CREATE`.
  `with-bpf-session` handles LSM programs with `(bpf:attach prog)` --
  no target argument needed.

### Bug Fixes

- **Return instruction across branches.** The emitter now always emits
  `mov r0, src` on return, even when the source is already in r0.
  Previously, multi-branch programs where different branches left the
  return value in different registers could produce incorrect code.

- **Parallel move resolution.** Fixed the safety check in the parallel
  move scheduler. The check now correctly tests whether the
  destination register is read as a source by another pending move,
  rather than checking the wrong direction.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-04-20


### New Features

- **Field-name context access.** `(ctx field-name)` reads a context
  struct field by name instead of raw offset. `(setf (ctx field-name) val)`
  writes. The compiler resolves fields from the program type's context
  struct (`xdp_md`, `__sk_buff`, `bpf_sock_addr`, `bpf_sock_ops`).
  Array fields use `(ctx user-ip6 0)`. Legacy `(ctx u32 4)` still works.

- **BTF-driven field resolution.** Context field offsets are resolved
  from `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` at compile time when available,
  matching the build host's actual kernel layout. Falls back to a
  static table when BTF is unavailable. Set `*vmlinux-btf-path*` for
  cross-compilation.

- **CO-RE relocations for context access.** Field-name `ctx` access
  emits BPF CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere) relocations
  automatically. The loader patches offsets at load time based on the
  target kernel's BTF. Both reads and writes are covered.

- **`defunion`**: Stack-allocate the size of the largest member and
  access through any member's field accessors. Useful for reusing a
  single buffer across protocol header types.

- **`ringbuf-output`**: Direct ring buffer output via
  `bpf_ringbuf_output` -- build a struct on the stack, then copy it
  in one helper call. Complements the existing `with-ringbuf`
  (reserve/submit) pattern.

- **Setf-able `ctx` form.** `(setf (ctx ...) val)` replaces the
  deprecated `ctx-store`. Supports multi-pair setf.

- **Mov-chain forwarding peephole pass.** Eliminates redundant
  register-to-register move chains in the post-regalloc BPF output.

### Bug Fixes

- **Store register clobbering.** Fixed cases where the emitter reused
  a source register as a scratch register during store operations,
  corrupting the value before it was written.

- **Ringbuf pointer spilling.** The register allocator now correctly
  handles ringbuf reserve pointers that are live across helper calls.

- **Mov-chain forwarding safety.** The peephole pass no longer forwards
  through moves whose source is overwritten before the consumer.

### New Example

- **Cgroup outbound firewall** (`examples/cgroup-firewall.lisp`): A
  process-level outbound firewall using three cooperating cgroup
  programs (`connect4`, `sockops`, `cgroup_skb/egress`) with shared
  maps, transparent proxy redirection, and ring buffer event logging.

## 1.6.2 — 2026-04-18


### Bug Fixes

- **TC detach scoped to our filter**: Previously, detaching a TC program
  removed all filters in the direction. Now only the specific pinned
  filter is cleaned up.

- **cgroup bind/post_bind support**: `cgroup/bind4`, `cgroup/bind6`,
  `cgroup/post_bind4`, and `cgroup/post_bind6` sections now correctly
  map to their expected attach types, fixing kernel load failures.

- **Tracepoint per-CPU attachment**: Tracepoint perf events are now
  opened on all online CPUs instead of only CPU 0. CPU enumeration
  uses actual IDs from sysfs, fixing attachment on sparse CPU
  topologies.

- **Removed dead `map-lookup-delete` code** that referenced a constant
  no longer present.

## 1.6.1 — 2026-04-11


### Migration Guide

#### defstruct CL-side type is now CLOS

The CL-side record type generated by `defstruct` is now a CLOS `defclass`
instead of a CL `defstruct`. The `-RECORD` suffix is retained. The public
API is unchanged:

```lisp
(make-my-event-record :pid 0 :ts 0)    ; constructor
(my-event-record-pid ev)               ; accessor
(decode-my-event bytes)                 ; decoder
(encode-my-event record)               ; encoder
```

If your code relied on CL struct internals (`copy-structure`, `#S(...)`
reader syntax, `my-event-record-p`), switch to standard CLOS patterns.

#### New convenience packages

Two packages are provided for REPL use, with CL symbol conflicts
pre-resolved:

```lisp
(in-package #:whistler-user)           ; compiler only
(in-package #:whistler-loader-user)    ; compiler + loader
```

`make repl` and `make repl-loader` use these by default.

#### Typed map operations

New loader functions eliminate manual key/value encoding:

```lisp
;; Before
(map-lookup info (encode-int-key 42 4))

;; After
(map-lookup-int info 42)
```

Full list: `map-lookup-int`, `map-update-int`, `map-delete-int`,
`map-lookup-struct-int`, `map-update-struct-int`,
`map-get-next-key-int`, and byte-vector variants without the `-int`
suffix.

#### Decoding ring buffer consumers

`open-decoding-ring-consumer` and `with-decoding-ring-consumer` auto-decode
events using a struct's `decode-NAME` function:

```lisp
;; Before
(open-ring-consumer map-info
  (lambda (sap len)
    (let ((buf (make-array len :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
      (dotimes (i len) (setf (aref buf i) (sb-sys:sap-ref-8 sap i)))
      (let ((ev (decode-my-event buf)))
        (process ev)))))

;; After
(with-decoding-ring-consumer (consumer map-info 'my-event)
  (ring-poll consumer :timeout-ms 1000))
```

### New Features

- `attach-obj-xdp` and `attach-obj-tc` in the loader.
- `bpf-session-map` and `bpf-session-prog` convenience accessors.
- `make repl` starts in `whistler-user`; `make repl-loader` starts in
  `whistler-loader-user`.

### Documentation

- Updated inline-session, ring buffer, and map documentation with new APIs.
- Updated defstruct docs to reflect CLOS record type.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-04-11


### New Features

- Torture test suite (`tests/test-torture.lisp`): 161 programs stress-testing
  ALU, comparisons, control flow, register pressure, maps, helpers, loops,
  packet parsing, and complex combinations. When run with `CAP_BPF`
  (`make test-torture`), output is validated against the real kernel BPF
  verifier. Codegen validation tests check constant folding, helper IDs,
  branch structure, callee-saved register usage, and stack allocation.

- Compile-time context access validation: `ctx-load` now checks access
  widths against the known context struct layout for XDP (`xdp_md`) and TC
  (`__sk_buff`) programs. Invalid widths produce a clear error with a fix
  suggestion.

### Bug Fixes

- **Wrong helper in map-lookup-delete fusion.** The SSA optimizer fused
  `map-lookup` + `map-delete` into BPF helper 46, which is
  `bpf_get_socket_cookie` -- not `bpf_map_lookup_and_delete_elem` (a
  userspace syscall, not an in-kernel helper). The fusion is disabled and
  the bogus constant removed.

- **Missing SSA phis for `setf` in loops.** `setf` inside `dotimes`
  updated the environment but did not create phi nodes at the loop header.
  `lower-dotimes` now pre-inserts phis for all in-scope variables; DCE
  removes unused ones.

- **Missing SSA phis for `setf` in branches.** `setf` in one arm of
  `if`/`when`/`unless` created a new vreg without merging at the join
  point. `lower-if` now inserts phis for variables whose vregs differ
  between branches.

- **Missing phi moves on `br-cond` edges.** `emit-br-cond-insn` emitted
  plain conditional + unconditional jumps without phi resolution copies.
  Phi-move emission is factored into a shared helper called by both `:br`
  and `:br-cond`, with trampoline blocks when needed.

- **Nested loop phi predecessor.** Inner `dotimes` referenced the program
  entry block instead of the block where the counter init was emitted.

- **R0 in caller-free pool.** The register allocator documented R0 as
  reserved but still included it in the allocatable pool.

### Documentation

- Fixed stale `ctx`-passing API across 7 book pages (`xdp-data ctx` etc.).
- Updated `defprog` syntax from `(&key ...)` to `(:type ... :section ...)`.
- Updated examples to use zero-argument accessor macros and `with-ringbuf`.
- `book/book/` added to `.gitignore`.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-04-02


### New Features

- Tracepoint attachment support in the loader. New `attach-tracepoint`
  function resolves tracepoint IDs from tracefs and attaches BPF programs
  via perf events. `bpf:attach` in `with-bpf-session` now automatically
  dispatches tracepoint programs. (issue #32)

- New `fork-tracker` example demonstrating inline BPF session with
  tracepoint attachment (`sched/sched_process_fork`).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix off-by-one in `section-to-prog-type` that caused tracepoint
  programs to be loaded as `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER`. (issue #32)

- Fix `+perf-type-tracepoint+` constant: was 1 (`PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE`),
  now correctly 2 (`PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT`). (issue #32)

## 1.4.0 — 2026-04-02


### New Features

- Add LRU hash map type support (`:lru-hash` in `defmap`). LRU hash maps
  automatically evict least-recently-used entries when full.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix helper call argument clobbering with parallel-move resolution (issue #31).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-03-30


### New Features

- `import-kernel-struct` now supports embedded (non-scalar) struct fields (#30)
  - Embedded struct accessors return the field address (`ptr + offset`) instead of attempting a load
  - Enables natural chaining: `(msghdr-msg-iter msg)` -> `(iov-iter-__iov iter)` -> `(iovec-iov-base iov)`
  - No more hardcoded offsets for navigating nested kernel structs
- Compile-time type checking for kernel struct pointers
  - `(as-msghdr ptr)` tags a pointer with its struct type
  - Accessors verify the tag at compile time -- passing the wrong struct type is an error
  - Embedded struct accessors propagate types automatically
  - Bare untyped pointers still work (fully backward compatible)

### Bug Fixes

- `import-kernel-struct` no longer silently drops non-scalar fields

## 1.2.0 — 2026-03-30


### Bug Fixes

- Fix kprobe/uprobe attachment opening one perf event per CPU, causing duplicate events on every probe hit (#29)
- Fix ringbuf mmap EPERM on kernels with strict memory protection checks (#27)
- Fix attach-tc BPF_OBJ_PIN field ordering and error handling

### New Features

- TC (sched_cls) packet parsing macros: `with-tc-packet`, `with-tc-tcp`, `with-tc-udp` with `TC_ACT_OK`/`TC_ACT_SHOT` return codes (#28)
- TC/clsact BPF program attachment via `attach-tc`
- Compile-time validation for 8 common BPF verifier failure patterns (atomic-add arity, alignment, unchecked map pointers, and more)
- Kprobe retprobe support in `attach-kprobe`

## 1.1.0 — 2026-03-28


### New features

- **`kernel-load` form** — Safely read from kernel pointers via
  `probe-read-kernel`. `(kernel-load u32 task 2772)` expands to a
  stack-alloc + probe-read-kernel + load sequence.

- **`import-kernel-struct` uses `kernel-load`** — Generated accessors
  now use `kernel-load` instead of direct `load`, making them safe for
  kernel pointers (e.g., from `get-current-task`) by default.

- **Anonymous struct/union flattening in `import-kernel-struct`** — The
  BTF parser now recursively descends into anonymous struct/union members,
  surfacing their fields as direct members. Fields like `skc_daddr` and
  `skc_dport` inside `sock_common`'s anonymous unions are now accessible.

- **`get-current-task` and `probe-read-kernel` helpers** — BPF helpers
  #35 and #113 for kernel struct traversal.

- **`reset-compilation-state`** — Exported function to clear accumulated
  maps/programs/structs between `compile-to-elf` calls in the REPL.

- **Stack usage breakdown in error messages** — When the 512-byte BPF
  stack limit is exceeded, the error now includes a per-category breakdown
  (struct-alloc, register spills, map key temporaries, etc.).

- **`:value-type` for `defmap`** — Explicit struct-valued map declarations.

- **aarch64 support for `pt-regs-parm1..6`** — Architecture-specific
  pt_regs offsets with compile-time error on unsupported platforms.

### Bug fixes

- **Fix phi-threading dropping vreg definitions (issue #12)** —
  `phi-branch-threading` redirected predecessor branches but left stale
  inputs in phi instructions. After `simplify-cfg` merged blocks, the phi
  destination vreg lost its definition, causing the emitter to assign it
  to a callee-saved register that collided with prior helper call results
  (e.g., `ktime-get-ns` in R7). Fixed by removing the threaded input from
  the phi when redirecting the predecessor.

- **Fix nil call-dst crash in `hoist-loads-before-calls`** — Void helper
  calls (unused result after dead-destination-elimination) caused a type
  error in the `/=` comparison.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-03-23


### Bug fixes

- **`with-bpf-session` from CL-USER** — Fixed a crash when using
  `with-bpf-session` from packages other than `whistler`. Symbols like
  `incf` and `getmap` in the `bpf:prog` body resolved to `CL:INCF` and
  `CL-USER::GETMAP` instead of their Whistler equivalents, causing the
  compiler to produce invalid IR. The session macro now re-interns body
  symbols into the `whistler` package before compilation.

- **Unbound variable error reporting** — Fixed a TYPE-ERROR in the
  lowerer's error handler that crashed instead of printing the diagnostic.
  The handler called `search` on a symbol instead of its name.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-03-22


Whistler 1.0 is a complete Lisp-to-eBPF platform: compiler, loader, and
inline session runtime — all in pure Common Lisp with zero external
dependencies.

### Compiler

An SSA-based optimizing compiler that produces eBPF ELF objects matching
or beating `clang -O2` on instruction count. Includes copy propagation,
constant propagation, SCCP, dead code elimination, LICM, CSE,
store-to-load forwarding, PHI-branch threading, bitmask fusion, ALU
narrowing, live-range splitting, and peephole optimization.

### Loader (`whistler/loader`)

A pure Common Lisp BPF userspace loader — no libbpf, no CFFI. Loads
`.bpf.o` files, creates maps, patches relocations, loads programs, and
attaches kprobes/uprobes/XDP. Includes ring buffer consumer and map
iteration. All syscalls via SBCL's `sb-alien`.

### Inline sessions (`with-bpf-session`)

Write BPF programs and userspace code in one Lisp form. The compiler runs
at macroexpand time; bytecode is embedded as a literal in the expansion:

```lisp
(with-bpf-session ()
  (bpf:map counter :type :hash :key-size 4 :value-size 8 :max-entries 1024)
  (bpf:prog trace (:type :kprobe :section "kprobe/..." :license "GPL")
    (incf (getmap counter 0)) 0)
  (bpf:attach trace "__x64_sys_execve")
  (loop (sleep 1) (format t "~d~%" (bpf:map-ref counter 0))))
```

### Kernel integration

- **`deftracepoint`** — auto-resolve tracepoint field offsets from
  `/sys/kernel/tracing/events/` at compile time.
- **`import-kernel-struct`** — import kernel struct definitions from
  `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` at compile time. No kernel headers needed.

### Struct codec

`whistler:defstruct` generates both BPF macros and CL-side struct with
byte-level decode/encode — one definition serves kernel and userspace.

### Protocol library

Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, ICMP headers with compile-time accessors
and statement-oriented parsing macros (`with-packet`, `with-tcp`, etc.).

### Polyglot header generation

`--gen c`, `--gen go`, `--gen rust`, `--gen python`, `--gen lisp` produce
matching struct definitions from `defstruct` — one source of truth.

### Since 0.7.0

- **SCCP pass** — sparse conditional constant propagation through PHIs
- **`deftracepoint`** — kernel tracepoint field auto-resolution
- **`import-kernel-struct`** — vmlinux BTF struct import
- **IPv6 and ICMP** protocol headers
- **`ir-dump`** for SSA inspection during development
- **Uprobe symbol fix** — correct PT_LOAD segment-based vaddr→file offset
- **Array codec fix** — non-u8 array fields decode/encode correctly
- **XDP attachment** — accepts mode (xdp/xdpdrv/xdpgeneric)
- **CPU topology** — handles comma-separated multi-range formats
- **Zero dependencies** — no external CL libraries required

## 0.7.0 — 2026-03-21


### New: `whistler/loader` — pure Common Lisp BPF loader

A complete userspace BPF loader with zero C dependencies. Load `.bpf.o`
files, create maps, attach probes, read maps, and consume ring buffers
from SBCL:

```lisp
(whistler/loader:with-bpf-object (obj "my-probes.bpf.o")
  (whistler/loader:attach-obj-kprobe obj "trace_execve" "__x64_sys_execve")
  ...)
```

Components: ELF parser, BPF map operations, map FD relocation patching,
program loading with verifier error capture, kprobe/uprobe/XDP attachment,
ring buffer consumer via mmap + epoll.

### New: `with-bpf-session` — inline BPF in one Lisp form

Compile BPF code at macroexpand time and load it at runtime. No `.bpf.o`
files, no build step — one file, one language:

```lisp
(with-bpf-session ()
  (bpf:map stats :type :hash :key-size 4 :value-size 8 :max-entries 1024)
  (bpf:prog counter (:type :kprobe :section "kprobe/..." :license "GPL")
    (incf (getmap stats 0)) 0)
  (bpf:attach counter "__x64_sys_execve")
  (loop (sleep 1) (format t "~d~%" (bpf:map-ref stats 0))))
```

The `bpf:` prefix separates kernel-side declarations from userspace CL code.
Uprobe vs kprobe is auto-detected from the section name.

### New: struct decode/encode for userspace

`whistler:defstruct` now generates a CL struct and byte codec alongside the
BPF macros — one definition serves both kernel and userspace:

- `NAME-RECORD` — CL `defstruct` with matching slots
- `decode-NAME` — bytes → CL struct
- `encode-NAME` — CL struct → bytes (round-trips perfectly)

### New features

- **MIT LICENSE file** added.
- **`--gen lisp`** documented in README alongside C/Go/Rust/Python.

### Improvements

- **Zero external CL dependencies.** Removed `cl-version-string`; version
  now comes from ASDF system definition. Only SBCL required.
- **Struct field stores auto-truncate.** No `cast` needed when writing a
  wider value to a narrow field — `(setf (my-u8-field ptr) u16-val)` works.
- **Self-contained ffi-call-tracker example.** Complete standalone inline
  BPF program with uprobe attachment and stats display in one Lisp file.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-03-21


### New features

- **`with-ringbuf`** — Reserve/null-check/submit pattern in one form:
  ```lisp
  (with-ringbuf (event events (sizeof my-event))
    (setf (my-event-type event) 1)
    ...)
  ```

- **`fill-process-info`** — Fill pid, uid, timestamp, and comm fields from
  BPF helpers using struct accessor names, replacing ~8 lines of boilerplate.

- **Multi-pair `setf`** — Standard CL `setf` with multiple place/value pairs:
  ```lisp
  (setf (my-struct-a ptr) 1
        (my-struct-b ptr) 2
        (my-struct-c ptr) 3)
  ```

- **`defmap` defaults** — `:key-size` and `:value-size` default to 0, so
  ringbuf maps only need `(defmap events :type :ringbuf :max-entries 262144)`.

- **Structured compiler errors** — All error messages now have `what`, `where`,
  `expected`, and `hint` fields with context-specific suggestions.

### Compile-time diagnostics

- **Narrow type as pointer** — Error when a `u8` or `u16` value is passed as
  a pointer argument to `probe-read`, `probe-read-user`, etc. (Fixes #8)

- **Helper argument count** — Error when a BPF helper is called with the wrong
  number of arguments (e.g., `(ktime-get-ns 42)` instead of `(ktime-get-ns)`).

- **Malformed let bindings** — Detects `(let (x 1) ...)` and suggests the
  correct `(let ((x 1)) ...)` with double parentheses.

- **Unbound variables** — Shows variables currently in scope.

- **Unknown forms** — Detects CL functions used in BPF context
  (e.g., `format`, `loop`) with an explanation that they're not available.

- **Stack overflow** — Reports exact bytes needed when the 512-byte BPF stack
  limit is exceeded.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-03-20


### Bug fixes

- **Fix ctx-load reading from uninitialized stack spill.** When the register
  allocator spilled the ctx vreg to the stack, `emit-ctx-load-insn` loaded
  from the uninitialized spill slot instead of using R6 (where ctx was
  saved). Now uses R6 directly for all ctx-loads. (Fixes #10)

- **Prevent register allocator from evicting ctx out of R6.** The spill
  candidate selection could evict the ctx interval and reassign R6 to another
  variable. The ctx interval now has infinite lifetime and is excluded from
  spill candidates. (Fixes #10)

- **Fix jump offset corruption in peephole self-move elimination.** The
  `eliminate-redundant-movs` pass used `remove-if` to delete `mov rX, rX`
  instructions without adjusting jump offsets, causing "jump out of range"
  verifier failures in large programs. Now uses `reindex-after-deletion`.
  (Fixes #11)

- **Fix peephole coalesce-copy setting register fields on JA instructions.**
  The register rename phase replaced dst/src fields on unconditional jump
  instructions which don't use them. The BPF verifier rejects non-zero
  reserved fields with "BPF_JA uses reserved fields". (Fixes #11)

## 0.5.3 — 2026-03-20


### Bug fixes

- **Fix R0 not set before exit after helper call in kprobe/tracepoint
  programs.** The `elide-tracepoint-return` optimization cleared return value
  operands for kprobe and tracepoint programs, causing bare `exit` instructions
  with undefined R0 after helper calls. The BPF verifier requires R0 to be
  set before every exit, regardless of program type. (Fixes #9)

- **Give `let` proper CL semantics (parallel bindings).** `let` previously
  evaluated bindings sequentially (like `let*`). Now all init forms are
  evaluated before any variables are bound, matching standard Common Lisp.

### New features

- **`let*` support.** Sequential binding form where each init can reference
  prior bindings in the same form.

- **`ash` support.** CL's arithmetic shift function now works in BPF programs
  with constant shift counts. Positive counts compile to left shifts, negative
  to right shifts. (Fixes #6)

## 0.5.2 — 2026-03-19


### Bug fixes

- **Fix BTF encoding for structs with array fields.** Array field types
  (`BTF_KIND_ARRAY`) were interleaved with struct member entries, producing
  malformed BTF that libbpf and bpftool rejected. (Fixes #1)

- **Fix ELF map symbols: emit `STT_OBJECT` with size.** Map symbols were
  emitted as `NOTYPE` with size 0, causing libbpf's `bpf_object__open()` to
  fail matching BTF `VAR` entries to ELF symbols. (Fixes #2)

- **Stop emitting CO-RE relocations for user-defined structs.** All struct
  field accesses generated CO-RE relocations, causing libbpf to search kernel
  BTF, fail, and replace every access with an invalid instruction. User-defined
  structs now emit direct loads/stores with compile-time offsets. (Fixes #3)

- **Convert BTF struct field names from hyphens to underscores.** Field names
  retained Lisp-style hyphens which the kernel BTF validator rejected as
  invalid C identifiers. (Fixes #4)

- **Use defprog name for FUNC symbols instead of section name.** FUNC symbols
  used the ELF section path (e.g. `kprobe/__x64_sys_execve`) which contains
  slashes that the kernel rejects. Now uses the defprog name. (Fixes #5)

## 0.5.1 — 2026-03-19


### Bug fixes

- **Fix phi resolution at loop back-edges.** Programs with helper calls
  (e.g. `probe-read-user`) inside `dotimes` loops could fail BPF verification
  with "R2 !read_ok" because the loop counter's caller-saved register was
  stale after helper calls clobbered it. The emitter now inserts phi
  resolution moves at all predecessor branches instead of only at the phi
  instruction site.

### New features

- **Struct-key map macros.** `getmap`, `setmap`, `incf`, `remmap`, and
  `delmap` now automatically dispatch to `-ptr` variants at compile time
  when the map's `:key-size` exceeds 8 bytes. No source changes needed —
  just use the high-level macros with struct pointer keys.

- **`do-user-ptrs`** — Iterate over a user-space array of pointers with
  automatic bounded iteration, pointer read, and null guard:
  ```lisp
  (do-user-ptrs (ptr base-ptr count +max+ :index i)
    body...)
  ```

- **`do-user-array`** — Iterate over a user-space array of scalars or
  structs:
  ```lisp
  (do-user-array (val u32 array-ptr count +max+)
    body...)
  (do-user-array (entry my-struct entries-ptr count +max+ :index i)
    body...)
  ```

## 0.5.0 — 2026-03-19


### Bug Fixes

- **Value-size-aware map macros.** `getmap`, `setmap`, `incf-map`, and
  `atomic-add` now derive the correct BPF operation width (u8/u16/u32/u64)
  from the map's declared `:value-size`. Previously these were hard-wired
  to 64-bit, emitting invalid `ldxdw`/64-bit atomics for maps with smaller
  value sizes.

- **Reject conflicting licenses in multi-program builds.** `compile-to-elf`
  now signals an error when programs declare different licenses instead of
  silently using the first program's license for all.

### New Optimization Passes

- **CFG simplification.** Folds constant branches, merges jump-only blocks
  and linear chains, removes unreachable blocks. Runs in a fixed-point
  loop to catch cascading opportunities.

- **Common subexpression elimination.** Intra-block CSE for pure ALU ops,
  byte-swaps, casts, and memory loads (invalidated on stores/calls).

- **Store-to-load forwarding.** Replaces loads from just-stored locations
  with the stored value, eliminating memory round-trips.

- **Loop-invariant code motion.** Detects natural loops, hoists invariant
  instructions (constants, ctx-loads, pure ALU) to the loop preheader.

- **Trivial phi elimination.** Collapses PHI nodes where all inputs
  converge to the same value.

- **Fixpoint canonicalization.** Copy-prop, const-prop, phi elimination,
  CFG simplification, and DCE now iterate to a fixed point, catching
  multi-step optimization chains that single-pass missed.

### Code Size Improvements

| Example          | 0.4.1 | 0.5.0 | Saved |
|------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| synflood-xdp     |    71 |    68 |    -3 |
| ratelimit-xdp    |    62 |    55 |    -7 |
| runqlat           |    57 |    37 |   -20 |
| multi-prog        |    45 |    44 |    -1 |

### Test Suite

- New FiveAM-based test suite with 138 checks across 11 test files,
  covering opcode-level instruction verification, all optimization
  passes, protocol parsing, map operations, tail calls, ring buffers,
  multi-program builds, and ELF output validation. Run with `make test`.

### New Example

- `percpu-counter.lisp` — demonstrates LICM hoisting ctx-loads out of
  a loop.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-03-18


### Improvements

- **Restore map FD caching with control-flow safety.** Map file
  descriptor caching in callee-saved registers is re-enabled, replacing
  2-instruction `ld_pseudo` sequences with 1-instruction `mov` for
  repeated map references. The cache now uses dominator analysis to
  ensure a cached register is only reused when the caching block
  dominates the current block, preventing use of uninitialized
  registers on paths that bypass the first map reference.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-03-18


### Bug Fixes

#### BTF / ELF Compatibility (cilium/ebpf, libbpf)

- **Emit proper BTF line_info section.** The kernel requires at least
  one `bpf_line_info` entry per function when `func_info` is present.
  Previously the section was empty, causing cilium/ebpf to fail with
  "can't read record size: EOF".

- **Sanitize BTF FUNC names.** Section names containing slashes (e.g.
  `tracepoint/sock/inet_sock_set_state`) are now stripped to the last
  path component for the BTF FUNC type name, since slashes are invalid
  in BTF identifiers.

- **Consistent naming between ELF symbols and BTF VARs.** Map names
  now use `lisp-to-c-name` (lowercase, hyphens→underscores)
  consistently in both ELF symbol table entries and BTF VAR/DATASEC
  types. Previously a mix of uppercase/hyphens vs lowercase/underscores
  caused cilium/ebpf to report symbol/VAR count mismatches.

- **Case-insensitive kernel struct field lookup.** CO-RE field index
  resolution for kernel structs (e.g. `xdp_md`) now uses
  case-insensitive comparison, fixing incorrect relocations for fields
  like `data_end`.

#### Register Allocation

- **Spill across ring buffer helper calls.** `ringbuf-reserve`,
  `ringbuf-submit`, and `ringbuf-discard` are now recognized as
  call-like operations, so the register allocator correctly spills
  caller-saved registers (R1-R5) across these BPF helper calls.

#### Code Generation

- **Forward-only jumps for return statements.** When a program has
  multiple `return` statements, their exit blocks are now placed at the
  end of the instruction stream. This prevents backward jumps that
  trigger the BPF verifier's infinite loop detection.

- **Disable cross-block map FD caching.** Map file descriptor caching
  in callee-saved registers did not account for control flow, causing
  "R9 !read_ok" verifier errors when a cached register was
  uninitialized on some paths. Caching is disabled until a
  control-flow-aware implementation is added.

#### Peephole Optimizer

- **Fix tail-merge direction.** Duplicate `mov r0, IMM; exit`
  epilogues are now replaced with forward jumps to the *last*
  occurrence (previously the first), ensuring all exit jumps go
  forward as required by the BPF verifier.

- **Preserve jump-target `goto` instructions.** `goto pc+0`
  elimination now checks whether the instruction is itself a jump
  target before deleting it, preventing conditional branches from
  targeting past-the-end positions.

- **Fix redundant mask elimination.** `AND rX, MASK` was incorrectly
  deleted when the register's known bit-width equaled the mask's
  container size (e.g. a byte-loaded value ANDed with `0x0f` was
  treated as a no-op because both were classified as "8-bit"). Mask
  width is now computed using `integer-length`, so `0x0f` is correctly
  identified as 4 bits.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-18


### New features

- **Array fields in defstruct** — `(field-name (array type count))` declares
  fixed-size array fields with C-compatible layout. Generates indexed
  accessors `(name-field ptr idx)` with `setf` support, and pointer
  accessors `(name-field-ptr ptr)` for passing array addresses to BPF
  helpers. Constant indices fold to fixed offsets at compile time; runtime
  indices skip the multiply for byte-sized elements.

- **sizeof** — `(sizeof struct-name)` expands to the struct's byte size at
  compile time. Replaces magic numbers in `probe-read-user`,
  `ringbuf-reserve`, etc.

- **memset** — `(memset ptr offset value nbytes)` fills memory with widened
  stores. 16 bytes of `#xFF` compiles to 2 u64 immediate stores instead of
  16 u8 stores. Values representable as signed 32-bit (like -1 for 0xFF
  fill) use `mov` instead of `ld_imm64`, saving 2 instructions per store.

- **memcpy** — `(memcpy dst dst-off src src-off nbytes)` copies memory using
  the widest possible load/store pairs.

- **pt-regs-parm1 through parm6, pt-regs-ret** — x86-64 `struct pt_regs`
  access macros matching C's `PT_REGS_PARM1()` etc. from `bpf_tracing.h`.
  Eliminates raw register offset constants in uprobe/kprobe programs.

- **BTF array support** — Array fields emit proper `BTF_KIND_ARRAY` entries
  in the `.BTF` section.

- **Codegen for array fields** — Shared header generation (C, Go, Rust,
  Python, Common Lisp) emits correct array syntax for each language:
  `uint8_t field[16]`, `[16]uint8`, `[u8; 16]`, `ctypes.c_uint8 * 16`.

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed ELF output tests** — Updated `write-minimal-elf` and
  `write-elf-with-maps` tests to use the multi-program `write-bpf-elf` API
  introduced in 0.2.0. All 14 tests now pass.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-17


### Bug fixes

- **Fixed peephole store-load forwarding bug** that caused incorrect code
  generation when a spilled register was overwritten between the store and
  reload. The BPF verifier would reject programs with "R1 type=scalar
  expected=fp". This affected programs using `probe-read-user` with
  struct-alloc destinations.

### New features

- **BTF-defined maps** — Maps now use the modern `.maps` section with full
  BTF type information (BTF_KIND_VAR, BTF_KIND_DATASEC, struct with
  type/key_size/value_size/max_entries fields). Compatible with current libbpf.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-03-17
